# MoodMapper

## Overview

This project aims to detect human emotions from images using deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Emotion detection from images has various applications, including human-computer interaction, mental health monitoring, market research, and security/surveillance.

## Motivation

Emotion detection from images is a fascinating and important area with numerous practical applications:

- **Human-Computer Interaction**: Enhance user experiences in virtual assistants, gaming, and social media platforms by responding appropriately to human emotions.
- **Mental Health Monitoring**: Contribute to mental health monitoring systems by providing insights into individuals' emotional states over time.
- **Market Research**: Analyze customers' reactions to products, advertisements, or services to make data-driven decisions.
- **Security and Surveillance**: Identify suspicious behavior or distress in real-time using emotion detection.

## Flowchart

The steps followed in the project are:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: Familiarize yourself with the problem of emotion detection and the dataset you're working with.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the image data, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation if necessary.
3. **Model Selection**: Choose or design a suitable neural network architecture for the problem, such as CNNs.
4. **Training**: Train the model on the training data, monitoring its performance on a separate validation set.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model on the test set to assess its performance and generalization ability.
